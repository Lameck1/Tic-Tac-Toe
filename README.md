## About
This project contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

## RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in the labelled cells.
3. The first player to get 3 of the marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
